# [Tool Name]

> One-line description.

## Purpose

What this tool does and why it exists. One paragraph. Focus on the gap it fills — what can't be done today without it.

## Program Context

How this tool connects to the CounterSignal program. What feeds into it, what it produces, and where it sits in the attack chain.

## Core Capabilities

Short list of what the tool does. Not implementation details — user-facing capabilities. Each item is a sentence, not a phrase.

## Key Design Decisions

Decisions that are already locked or strongly leaning. Architecture, tech stack, UX, and scope boundaries. These constrain future implementation and prevent scope drift.

- **Cross-platform** — must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. No platform-specific shell commands in source or test fixtures. See scaffold Development Guidelines for the full standard.

## Open Questions

Unresolved decisions that need research, prototyping, or deliberation before implementation begins. Each question should state what's at stake.

## Artifacts

What the tool produces as output — reports, evidence files, logs. What a researcher walks away with after using it.

## Relation to Other Tools

Explicit boundaries with adjacent tools. What this tool does NOT do, and which tool covers that instead. Prevents scope creep.
